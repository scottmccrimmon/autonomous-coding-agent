**Self-Reflection Rubric**

Score each dimension from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent):

* Correctness: Does the Dockerized workflow behave as intended?
* Simplicity: Is the solution minimal and easy to understand?
* Maintainability: Would another engineer be comfortable extending this?
* Docker Best Practices: Are conventions followed appropriately?
* Documentation Quality: Could someone else run this without help?

If any score is below 4, identify why and iterate.
