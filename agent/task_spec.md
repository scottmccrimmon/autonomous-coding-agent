**Task: Dockerize an Existing MNIST CNN Training Project**

You are an autonomous coding agent tasked with adding Docker support to an existing MNIST CNN training project.

The project currently consists of:

* a small Python codebase for loading MNIST data
* a training script for a CNN model
* no containerization support

Your goal is to enable the project to be run reproducibly using Docker, following standard Python and ML engineering best practices.

You must:

* create appropriate Docker configuration files
* minimize unnecessary changes to existing Python code
* document how to build and run the container
* ensure the containerized workflow produces the same functional behavior as the original project

You should assume this is a learning and demonstration project, not a production system.
